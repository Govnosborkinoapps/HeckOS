## How to install?

The easiest way is to use default **wget** script. Insert an OpenOS floppy disk and an Internet Card into the computer, turn it on and type the following command to console to install MineOS:

	wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IgorTimofeev/MineOS/master/Installer/BIOS.lua /tmp/bios.lua && flash -q /tmp/bios.lua && reboot

You can paste it to console using middle mouse button or Insert key (by default). After a moment, a nice system installer will be shown. You will be prompted to select your preferred language, boot volume (can be formatted if needed), create a user profile and customize some settings
